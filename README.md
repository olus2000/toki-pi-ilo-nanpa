# toki pi ilo nanpa
Toki pi ilo nanpa is a esoteric programming language based on a constructed human language toki pona and instpired by a scripted language Lua. It was invented by [me](https://esolangs.org/wiki/User:Olus2000) and its specification is described on it's [esolangs wiki page](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Toki_pi_ilo_nanpa).

This repo offers a bunch of tools related to interpreting the language: rply-based lexer and parser, a class for parsing, compiling, decompiling and running toki code, and an interface for the class to use in a command line. Maybe the latter would make more sense if I learned how to build python modules.
